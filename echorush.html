                    EchoRush is a fast-paced 2D platformer where the player takes control of a young bat who 
                    has been accidentally left behind by his family. The player is in complete darkness and 
                    needs to echolocate in order to reveal the environment around them, all the while maneuvering 
                    through obstacles and chasing after their family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project was created for the university subject 31262 Game Design Methodologies. Students 
                    formed small teams and participated in what was essentially a 6-week game jam, where 5 themes were 
                    presented and at least 2 needed to be incorporated into the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our group decided to pick the themes of "Lower the Volume" and "Limited Screentime". We made the 
                    main mechanic tie into these two themes by having the echolocation lower in volume after being used, 
                    and by also having it be the only way that the player can see the environment. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most notable things that I was responsible for during this project were:

                    The movement system was largely inspired by that of Celeste's, which I had never played before prior to 
                    the development of the project, and that I had remembered that it was sitting in my Epic Games library 
                    collecting digital dust after I claimed it for free several years ago during one of Epic's weekly free 
                    game deals. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyways, the system features running, jumping, wall jumping, wall climbing, wall sliding, mantling, 
                    and gliding. There are quite a few things that happen behind the scenes in order to make all of the movement 
                    feel fluid. For example, jumping and wall jumping have "coyote time", which lets players jump while mid-air 
                    if they've missed the ground by a slight amount, which makes jumping feel more responsive and forgiving. 
                    The player also briefly keeps the momentum they gain from being pushed by strong wind or flowing water, and 
                    this momentum is lost while the player is normally grounded in order to make landing easier and more accurate 
                    to the player's inputs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn't want the movement to resemble Celeste too much so I decided to swap the dash for a 
                    glide, which was inspired by Knuckles from the 2D Sonic the Hedgehog games. The glide mechanic is introduced 
                    in Level 2 alongside the wind mechanic. The design of both mechanics tie into each other; the player is only 
                    affected by wind while gliding. This leads to novel interactions with wind, as it can be a benefit or obstacle 
                    depending on how the area of the level is designed.
