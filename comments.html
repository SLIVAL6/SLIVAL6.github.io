        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            This website was designed to be technically sound, aesthetically pleasing, and 
            to have great accessibility. These aspects are used together in order to make 
            the website functional and easy to read.
        </p>

        </table>
        <p>
            Each web page has a body, which can be further separated into a header and division.
            The header for each page is the menu navigation bar, and is the same for each page in 
            order to be consistent. Depending on what page is currently being displayed, the button 
            with the name of the page in the navigation bar is highlighted in order to show that the 
            user is on the page. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The div for each page contains different HTML elements such as headers, paragraphs, tables, 
            and more.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>index.html - Headers, paragraphs, unordered list.</li>
            <li>past.html - Table, span, grid of images.</li>
            <li>future.html - Headers, paragraphs.</li>
            <li>comments.html - Headers, paragraphs, table</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The CSS file contains 7 classes and 2 id's which are used in the HTML pages. 5 classes are 
            under a name called "menu", which are used to create the styling for the menu navigation 
            bar at the top of each page. The menu class manages the positioning and padding of all 
            elements within that navigation bar, and also changes the colour of buttons when the cursor 
            is hovered over them, which creates instant feedback for the user. Another class is menu_h1,
            which is used to override the settings for the h1 text in the navigation bar. While trying 
            to implement this, I encountered difficulties in which writing ".menu h1" did not apply 
            any changes to the h1 text in the navigation bar. Instead, I needed to create an entirely new 
            class in order to do this, which I am still quite confused about. Nevertheless, it works at 
            least. The final class I implemented in the CSS file is gallery, which is used to format 
            the images into a grid in past.html.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to those classes, I created an id called lightblue which is applied to the text 
            in past.html to highlight that it is the name of a product that I have created. The id simply 
            changes the colour of that text within the span. The other 2 id's I implemented were called 
            comments_table, which simply overrides the size of the table and the size of the first column 
            of the table, which was necessary as some text in the first column was clipping through into 
            other columns.
        </p>
        <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
        <p>
            The aesthetics of the website have been designed to provide an easy-to-read experience for 
            the user, whilst also creating a sense of formatting and structure through colour and font 
            size. Below is a list of how this has been implemented.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The colour scheme of the website is a gradient of blue, with mixes of dark and light hues 
                in order to create a contrast which is easy on the eyes, and yet is consistent in colour 
                throughout the website. The following colours are used: #ffffff, #0f4c75, #bbe1fa, #1b262c, 
                #3282b8. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Headings are ordered in font size through the CSS file, with h1 having the largest font size 
                and h3 having the smallest font size out of the headings. This creates a sense of 
                hierarchical order within the structure of text for each page, which leads to a better reading 
                experience for the user.
            </li>
            <li>
                The font used for the entire website is Helvetica, which is sans-serif. Sans-serif fonts are 
                easier to read and thus make the website more readable for the user.
            </li>
            <li>
                The menu navigation bar at the top of each page has rounded diagonals which give it a unique, 
                intriguing look that grabs the user's attention. Furthermore, the buttons have this same shape 
                for consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
                The buttons in the menu navigation bar change to a lighter colour when the cursor is hovering 
                over in order to show to the user that they can be interacted with. Furthermore, the button of 
                the page that is currently being displayed is a different colour to show to the user that there 
                is no need to click that button since they are already on that page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Margins are applied to the entire website in order to reduce the amount of horizontal space 
                needed to read the screen. This makes the website easier to read for the user, whilst also making 
                the website more presentable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Padding is used for all text, including paragraphs and text in tables in order to make it easier 
                to read and aesthetically pleasing.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
            Accessibility is an important part of web design and has been incorporated into the creation of this 
            website. The website has been designed to be accessible as possible so that users with disabilities 
            are not unable to read or navigate the website. Below is a list of how this has been implemented.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                All fonts adjust their size depending on the width and height of the browser. This is achieved 
                through implementing relative font sizes in the CSS stylesheet, where font sizes use a percentage 
                of the default font size instead of being hard coding the font size with a set amount of pixels 
                that cannot adapt to the browser size.
            </li>
            <li>
                The colour scheme of the website makes it so that the text is a white colour against a dark blue 
                background, which creates a great contrast and makes the text easier to read and more accessible 
                to those with visual impairments.
            </li>
            <li>
                All images have alt text in order to assist those with visual disabilities. The alt text can be 
                read aloud in order to provide a description of the image, which helps those who are unable to 
                see the image itself to know what it is meant to look like. This also provides a benefit in case 
                images do not load, as the alt text will be displayed instead.
            </li>
            <li>
                Font sizes always adjust to the browser size and are therefore always at a suitable size that can 
                comfortably be read by any user. This helps those with visual impairments to more easily read the 
                text of the website.
            </li>
        </ul>
