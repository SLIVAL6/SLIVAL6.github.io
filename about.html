        <h3>About Myself</h3>
        <p>
            I'm Sam, a 3rd year student at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia, currently 
            undertaking the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) for Software Engineering. I'm also learning 
            game development in my own time using C# and the Unity game engine.

        <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
        <p>I have experience using:</p>

        <p>
            I have a good proficiency with the Unity game engine, and I'm hoping to learn how to use the Unreal 
            game engine next. That would also include improving my skills in C++ as it's the main language used 
            by Unreal engine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other than programming skills, I'm also looking to improve my skills in game design and project 
            management. I'm planning to do this by participating in more game jams in groups and by also doing 
            more projects with others.
        </p>
        <h3>Programming Experience</h3>
        <p>
            I've had no coding experience prior to starting university, as I highly doubt that 
            using Scratch counts. I started to practise writing proper code in my first year of studying 
            Software Engineering at UTS in 2021. It was quite challenging at first as a lot of the concepts 
            being introduced were completely brand new to me. I would say that the experience of learning 
            how to code for the first time was really like learning a new language. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After completing other programming-related subjects in subsequent years, I've started to become 
            more confident and get the hang of coding. I used to struggle with programming basic functionalities 
            in Java, and always never knew what static and non-static meant. Now, after completing several 
            projects in both software and games, and after gaining a lot more experience, I'm able come up with 
            ideas in my head and translate them into code, which is something that I'm quite content with.
            I've now won multiple awards for projects that I've worked on, which you can read more about on the 
            <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I still have a lot to learn about programming and my skills can be further improved.
        </p>
        <h3>Ambitions</h3>
        <p>
            I'm interested in pursuing a career in video game development. I'm progressing 
            towards this goal by taking elective subjects in game development at UTS, whilst also 
            working on my own game projects in my spare time. The games industry in Sydney 
            is difficult to break into as it still quite new, but I am still hoping that 
            through perseverance I can find some way to get a game development career.
        </p>
        <h3>Other Stuff</h3>
        <p>
            I make custom levels for Spin Rhythm XD, a rhythm game. You can find more of my levels on my
