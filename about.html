        <h3>Programming Experience</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a 3rd year student at the University of Technology Sydney, currently undertaking the Bachelor of 
            Engineering (Honours) for Software Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to starting university, I have had no prior coding experience, as I highly doubt that 
            using Scratch counts. I started to practise writing proper code in my first year of studying 
            Software Engineering at university, with Programming 1. It was quite challenging at first as 
            a lot of the concepts being introduced were completely brand new to me. After completing 
            other programming-related subjects I started to become more confident and get the hang of it. 
            However, I still have a lot to learn about programming and my skills can improve further.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is a table that shows each subject that I have completed at UTS so far that has 
            involved programming.

        <p>
            Over the course of my programming journey so far, I would say that I am most comfortable coding
            in C# or Java. On the other hand, I am the least comfortable coding in C++, which is something I 
            am hoping to improve. 
        </p>
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>
            One of the most interesting programming subjects I have done is Introduction to Computer Game 
            Development. In that subject, I made a game called <span id="lightblue">"PACSTUDENT VS. THE MUTANT 
            SLIME HORROR"</span>, which is a spin on the classic arcade game Pac-Man. This game was created 
            using the Unity game engine, with scripts written in C#. Below are some images of the game.
        </p>
        <div class="gallery">
            <img src="./images/pacstudent1.png" alt="Main menu. There is a high score and best 
            time recorded for each level. There are buttons for Level 1 and Level 2.">
            <img src="./images/pacstudent2.png" alt="Level 1. Symmetrical map layout with mazes, 
            with green pellets all over. The player is a slime, and the four enemies are mutant slimes.">
            <img src="./images/pacstudent3.png" alt="Level 1. The enemies are in a scared state 
            and are moving away from the player to avoid being defeated.">
            <img src="./images/pacstudent4.png" alt="Level 2. The player has limited visibility, 
            and has a small circular field of vision around the player.">
            <img src="./images/pacstudent5.png" alt="Level 2. The player is almost in complete 
            darkness with an incredibly small field of vision. Nearly the entire screen is black.">
        </div>
        <h3>Ambitions</h3>
        <p>
            I'm interested in pursuing a career in video game development. I'm progressing 
            towards this goal by taking electives in game development at UTS, whilst also 
            working on my own game projects in my spare time. The games industry in Sydney 
            is difficult to break into as it still quite new, but I am still hoping that 
            through perseverance I can find some way to get a game development career.
        </p>
        <h3>Improving Skills</h3>
        <p>
            While game development is a big focus of mine, a good thing to keep in mind is 
            that the programming aspect of game development is essentially software 
            engineering. As a result, I would like to improve my software engineering skills 
            whilst also improving my programming skills too. C++ is a language in particular 
            that I am interested in working with further, as it is a requirement for using 
            the Unreal game engine, which is a big competitor of the Unity game engine which 
            uses C# for scripting. I am planning to improve my skills by creating projects in 
            my own time which I can add to my portfolio, whether that be video games or other 
            software.
