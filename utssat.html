                    The UTS Scheduling Assistant Tool (UTS SAT) is a website tool for UTS tutors to manage and 
                    schedule classes. I participated in this project as part of the university subject 41113 
                    Software Development Studio at UTS. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this subject, students formed groups and were tasked with working on a real software 
                    project. In my case, our group worked on developing UTS SAT with supervision from the 
                    product owner, Timothy Boye. The development had been handed over to us from a previous 
                    team who had also worked on the software during Software Development Studio. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our group followed agile practices and participated in fortnightly sprints and weekly scrum 
                    and client meeting. We used Jira to manage and observe our workflow, and utilised its 
                    features such as the Kanban board and burndown chart. We used Confluence to manage documents 
                    and reports, and record user stories, meeting minutes, and sprint retrospectives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project, I assumed the role of systems tester, which included QA testing and writing 
                    detailed bug reports. In my bug report, each issue had a brief description, steps to reproduce 
                    the bug, the outcome of following those steps, and the expected outcome without issues. 
                    After finding bugs, I was responsible for communicating them to relevant teammates in order 
                    to resolve them.
