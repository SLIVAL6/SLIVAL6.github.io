                    Armless Samurai is a single-player fast-paced combat game where you play as a samurai with no arms. 
                    Dash, kick and fight your way through a seemingly endless fortress with fresh and dynamic combat on 
                    your mission to seek vengeance. Face off against numerous monstrous machines and swiftly manoeuvre 
                    past tricky obstacles to ascend the fortress to fulfill your vengeful mission.

                    This game was created as part of the yearly Playmakers Dev Team project, where students work together 
                    on a game over the course of a semester. This year, there were over 20 students participating in the 
                    development of Armless Samurai. The workflow simulates that of a small game development studio, with 
                    students split into smaller department teams, such as programming, art, music, marketing and design. 
                    Development took place over several sprints, with weekly sprint meetings using the Agile framework.
