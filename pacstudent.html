            <p>
                PACSTUDENT Vs. THE MUTANT SLIME HORROR (we'll just shorten it to Pacstudent) is a spin on the 
                classic arcade game Pac-Man.

            time recorded for each level. There are buttons for Level 1 and Level 2.">

                One of the most interesting programming subjects I have done is Introduction to Computer Game 
                Development. In that subject, I made a game called "PACSTUDENT VS. THE MUTANT 
                SLIME HORROR", which is a spin on the classic arcade game Pac-Man. This game was created 
                using the Unity game engine, with scripts written in C#. Below are some images of the game.

            <img src="./images/pacstudent2.png" alt="Level 1. Symmetrical map layout with mazes, 
            with green pellets all over. The player is a slime, and the four enemies are mutant slimes.">
