                    PACSTUDENT VS. THE MUTANT SLIME HORROR (or just Pacstudent) is a spin on the 
                    classic arcade game Pac-Man. It is a project created for the university subject 31263 
                    Introduction to Computer Game Development at UTS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this subject, students were required to completely recreate Pac&#8209;Man from scratch, but 
                    with completely different visuals, audio and enemy behaviour from the original. The second level 
                    also includes a brand-new mechanic, where the map is completely covered in darkness, and the 
                    player has an area of vision around them that slowly decreases over time. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <img src="./images/pacstudent1.png" alt="Main menu. There is a high score and best 
            time recorded for each level. There are buttons for Level 1 and Level 2.">
            <img src="./images/pacstudent2.png" alt="Level 1. Symmetrical map layout with mazes, 
            with green pellets all over. The player is a slime, and the four enemies are mutant slimes.">

                    As this was a solo project, I was responsible for everything, including programming, design, art, 
                    et cetera. All art and animations were created by myself in Aseprite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to go for a simple colour palette of black, white and green in order to simplify the art 
                    and animation processes for myself. This simple colour scheme and art style was inspired by the games 
                    Downwell, Luftrausers, and Minit. All three of these games have a limited colour palette, and yet have 
                    visuals that look great and stand out, which is why I decided to go with this simple visual style 
                    for Pacstudent.

                    Since Pacstudent was created as an assessment task, there were a few requirements that students needed to 
                    follow. One of those was that all of the movements of the player and enemies needed to be implemented 
                    through linear lerping and tweening. All tweening code needed to be created from scratch as external 
                    tween libraries could not be used. Due to this implementation of movement, the controls may feel 
                    slightly unresponsive as the player needs to finishing lerping to a grid position before processing 
                    the last input.
                </p>
            </div>
            <img src="./images/pacstudent3.png" alt="Level 1. The enemies are in a scared state 
            and are moving away from the player to avoid being defeated.">
            <img src="./images/pacstudent4.png" alt="Level 2. The player has limited visibility, 
            and has a small circular field of vision around the player.">
            <div>
                <p>
                    Another assessment requirement was that each enemy needed to have its own unique AI behaviour. External 
                    libraries and Unity Pathfinding were not allowed, and all behaviours needed to be coded from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each enemy has a unique behaviour:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enemy 1: Move away from the player.</li>
                    <li>Enemy 2: Move closer to the player.</li>
                    <li>Enemy 3: Move in a random direction.</li>
                    <li>Enemy 4: Move clockwise around the perimeter of the map.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The second level features a new mechanic where the player has a limited area of vision that decreases 
                    over time. I decided to go with this design as I felt that it would fit the overall eerie theme. The mechanic 
                    would make it difficult for the player to keep track of where all the enemies are, and keep the player 
                    guessing. It would also lead to moments where the player would be surprised by an enemy turning a corner when 
                    they least expect it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ocassionally, a flask collectable will float across the screen in a straight line, and 
                    act as a source of light. The player can collect this to get bonus points and also increase their area of vision. 
                    This leads to gameplay where the player is encouraged to collect flasks or suffer the consequence of having 
                    severely limited vision.
