        <h3>Ambitions</h3>
        <p>
            I'm interested in pursuing a career in video game development. I'm progressing 
            towards this goal by taking electives in game development at UTS, whilst also 
            working on my own game projects in my spare time. The games industry in Sydney 
            is difficult to break into as it still quite new, but I am still hoping that 
            through perseverance I can find some way to get a game development career.
        </p>
        <h3>Improving Skills</h3>
        <p>
            While game development is a big focus of mine, a good thing to keep in mind is 
            that the programming aspect of game development is essentially software 
            engineering. As a result, I would like to improve my software engineering skills 
            whilst also improving my programming skills too. C++ is a language in particular 
            that I am interested in working with further, as it is a requirement for using 
            the Unreal game engine, which is a big competitor of the Unity game engine which 
            uses C# for scripting. I am planning to improve my skills by creating projects in 
            my own time which I can add to my portfolio, whether that be video games or other 
            software.
