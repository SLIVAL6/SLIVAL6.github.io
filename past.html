        <h3>Programming Experience</h3>
        <p>
            Prior to starting university, I have had no prior coding experience, as I highly doubt that 
            using Scratch counts. I started to practise writing proper code in my first year of studying 
            Software Engineering at university, with Programming 1. It was quite challenging at first as 
            a lot of the concepts being introduced were completely brand new to me. After completing 
            other programming-related subjects I started to become more confident and get the hang of it. 
            However, I still have a lot to learn about programming and my skills can improve further.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is a table that shows each subject that I have completed at UTS so far that has 
            involved programming.

        <p>
            Over the course of my programming journey so far, I would say that I am most comfortable coding
            in C# or Java. On the other hand, I am the least comfortable coding in C++, which is something I 
            am hoping to improve.

        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>
            One of the most interesting programming subjects I have done is Introduction to Computer Game 
            Development. In that subject, I made a game called <span id="lightblue">"PACSTUDENT VS. THE MUTANT 
            SLIME HORROR"</span>, which is a spin on the classic arcade game Pac-Man. This game was created 
            using the Unity game engine, with scripts written in C#. Below are some images of the game.

            time recorded for each level. There are buttons for Level 1 and Level 2.">
            <img src="pacstudent2.png" alt="Level 1. Symmetrical map layout with mazes, 
            with green pellets all over. The player is a slime, and the four enemies are mutant slimes.">

            and has a small circular field of vision around the player.">

            darkness with an incredibly small field of vision. Nearly the entire screen is black.">
