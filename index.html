        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Salutations. My name is Samuel (also known as SLIVAL online), and you're currently on my website.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a 3rd year student at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia, currently undertaking the Bachelor of 
            Engineering (Honors) for Software Engineering. This website aims to give a bit of insight into myself, 
            whilst also showcasing the skills I've accrued and projects I've worked on over the past few years and 
            the years to come. It details my personal experiences with programming, and my ambitions for the 
            future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most importantly, this website shows my growth over time as a software and game developer.
