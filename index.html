        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Salutations. My name is Samuel, and you're currently on my website for a Web Systems assignment. 
            I'm a student at the University of Technology Sydney, currently undertaking the Bachelor of 
            Engineering (Honors) for Software Engineering. This website is an assignment for the Web Systems 
            subject at UTS. It details my personal experiences with programming, my ambitions for the 
            future, and also how this website was created.
